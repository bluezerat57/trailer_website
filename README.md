# Movie Trailer Website
A project made in Python that shows a movie poster lineup and their trailers on a standalone webpage.
Created as as part of the Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree course.

## Setting up
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Make sure you have Python Installed [(download from here)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

The `fresh_tomatoes.py` is a script provided by Udacity's course. The file has been modified slightly, but all credit goes to Udacity's folks.

## Running the program
Open the `trailer_website.py` file on a Python IDE (included in the Python link above), and run it. Done!

## Changing the movie lineup
To change the movies shown in the webpage, open the `trailer_website.py` file and add or delete as many movies as you want. If you want to add a movie, you will need to add the following information:
- Title
- Description
- Poster image url
- Movie trailer url

When you're done editing, just save and run!
